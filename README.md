# Hey!

Get a notification when this boring command is done! (yes, "hey!" is the name of my package, don't blame me...)

## Getting Started

You probably already been waiting for a command to end. Man, we are in 2018 atm, get notified when your command is done! 

### Installing

This package is an npm package. You just need to install it globally.

```
npm install -g @adeneu/hey
```
or if you use yarn
```
yarn global add @adeneu/hey
```

## Running the tests

Simply write the command you to run with "hey" behind it.
It will run your command as a normal command but send you a desktop notification when it's done.

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
